**IPCO** (Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization) is a conference that is sponsored by the Mathematical Programming Society. IPCO is a forum for researchers and practitioners working on various aspects of integer programming and combinatorial optimization. The aim is to present recent developments in theory, computation, and applications of integer programming and combinatorial optimization.

The conference and summer school will take place at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu) in Baltimore, Maryland, USA.
