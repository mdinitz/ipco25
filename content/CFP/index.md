## Call For Papers
### Important Dates
- **Summer school**: June 9 - 10, 2025
- **Main conference**: Jun 11- 13, 2025

### Scope
The IPCO conference is a forum for researchers and practitioners working on various aspects of integer programming and combinatorial optimization. The aim is to present recent developments in theory, computation, and applications. The scope of IPCO is viewed in a broad sense, to include algorithmic and structural results in integer programming and combinatorial optimization as well as revealing computational studies and novel applications of discrete optimization to practical problems.

Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of their recent work; see the submission guidelines below for more information. The Program Committee will select the papers to be presented on the basis of the submitted extended abstracts. Contributions are expected to be original, unpublished and not under review by journals or conferences with proceedings before the notification date. Papers violating these requirements will not be considered by the Program Committee.

During the conference, approximately 33 papers will be presented in single-track sessions. Each lecture will be 30 minutes long and given by one of the authors in person (on-site). The proceedings will be published as a volume of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science. They will contain extended abstracts of all accepted submissions. It is expected that revised and extended versions will subsequently be submitted for publication in appropriate journals, for example in the special issue of Mathematical Programming B that will be devoted to IPCO 2025.

### Submission Guidelines and Instructions for Authors
The extended abstract must not exceed 12 pages in Springer LNCS format, plus references. Please check the [Springer Information for LNCS Authors](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) for additional information. If necessary, an appendix containing additional technical material can be added and may be considered at the discretion of the Program Committee. Alternatively, authors are encouraged to include a link to a full version in a freely accessible online repository.

The first page should contain the title, the authorsâ€™ names with their affiliations, and a short abstract. The introduction should be a broadly accessible exposition of the main ideas and techniques used to achieve the results, including motivation and a clear comparison with related work. In particular, the introduction should convey to the non-expert why the paper should be accepted to IPCO. Submitted extended abstracts will be reviewed according to the standards of top tier reviewed conferences. The main acceptance criteria used by the Program Committee are the quality and originality of the research, plus its interest to people working in the field. It is crucial that the importance of the work is understood by the committee. The claimed results must be correct and new.

A paper will not be considered in any of the following cases:

- It has already been published.
- It is under review by a journal or another conference with proceedings.
- It has a member of the Program Committee among its authors.
- It is submitted after the submission deadline.
- It is not allowed to submit a paper that has been submitted to IPCO 2025 to a journal or a conference with proceedings before the notification date.
