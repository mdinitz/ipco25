# Call for Papers

IPCO 2025 -- The 26th Conference on Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization\
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA\
June 11-13, 2025

### Important Dates

- **Submission deadline**: November 4, 2024, 23:59 AoE
- **Notification**: January 22, 2025
- **Final versions for proceedings**: April 2, 2025
- **Conference**: June 11-13, 2025

### Scope

The IPCO conference is a forum for researchers and practitioners working on various aspects of integer programming and combinatorial optimization. The aim is to present recent developments in theory, computation, and applications. The scope of IPCO is viewed in a broad sense, to include algorithmic and structural results in integer programming and combinatorial optimization as well as revealing computational studies and novel applications of discrete optimization to practical problems.

Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of their recent work by November 4, 2024; see the submission guidelines below for more information. The Program Committee will select the papers to be presented on the basis of the submitted extended abstracts. 

Contributions are expected to be original, unpublished and not under review by journals or conferences with proceedings before the notification date (January 22, 2024). Papers violating these requirements will not be considered by the Program Committee.

During the conference, approximately 33 papers will be presented in single-track sessions. Each lecture will be 30 minutes long and given by one of the authors in person (on-site). The proceedings will be published as a volume of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science. They will contain extended abstracts (at most 14 pages) of all accepted submissions. It is expected that revised and extended versions will subsequently be submitted for publication in appropriate journals, for example in the special issue of Mathematical Programming B that will be devoted to IPCO 2025.


### Best Paper Award

IPCO will present a Best Paper Award, to be chosen by the Program Committee.


### Submission Guidelines and Instructions for Authors

Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract for a double-blind reviewing process. 
Submissions must be formatted in LaTeX using the Springer LNCS style and can have a maximum length of 12 pages, plus references and an optional appendix. Please check the Springer Information for LNCS Authors for additional information. An appendix containing additional technical material and full proofs can be added for consideration by the program committee and will not be published in the proceedings. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be placed in an appendix to enable the main mathematical claims of the submission to be fully verified.

The first page should contain the title and a short abstract. The introduction should be a broadly accessible exposition of the main ideas and techniques used to achieve the results, including motivation and a clear comparison with related work. In particular, the introduction should convey to the non-expert why the paper should be accepted to IPCO. Submitted extended abstracts will be reviewed according to the standards of top tier reviewed conferences. The main acceptance criteria used by the Program Committee are the quality and originality of the research, plus its interest to people working in the field. It is crucial that the importance of the work is understood by the committee. The claimed results must be correct and new.

A paper will not be considered in any of the following cases:
– It has already been published.
– It is under review by a journal or another conference with proceedings.
– It has a member of the Program Committee among its authors.
– It is submitted after the submission deadline.
It is not allowed to submit a paper that has been submitted to IPCO 2025 to a journal or a conference with proceedings before the notification date.

IPCO 2025 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission, and authors should refer to their own work in the third person. The purpose of this double-blind process is to help reviewers make unbiased initial judgments about the paper, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are. Authors should not weaken their submission or make reviewing more difficult for the sake of anonymity; in particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. Authors are encouraged to share their ideas or draft versions of their paper as usual, such as posting drafts online, submitting to repositories, and giving talks.

Papers failing to adhere to the guidelines (e.g., by not providing the omitted proofs in an appendix, exceeding the page limit, not being in LNCS format, or not following the double-blind rules) risk to be rejected without consideration of their merits.
