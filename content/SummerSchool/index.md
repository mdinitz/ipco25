Daniel Dadush is a senior researcher at CWI in Amsterdam and a part time full professor at Utrecht university. He completed his PhD at Georgia Tech within the Algorithmics, Combinatorics and Optimization program in 2012, and was a Simons postdoctoral fellow at the Courant Institute at NYU before joining CWI in 2014. He is a recipient of the 2015 A.W. Tucker prize for best thesis in mathematical optimization, as well as an ERC Starting Grant in 2019. His research focuses on the analysis and development of algorithms for linear and integer programming, both in the worst-case and beyond. 

#### Aida Khajavirad

Aida Khajavirad is an Assistant Professor of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Lehigh University. Before joining Lehigh, she worked at Rutgers University, University of Texas at Austin and IBM TJ Watson Research Center. She received her PhD from Carnegie Mellon University in 2012. Aida's research goal is to advance the state-of-the-art in Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Optimization (MINLP) at theoretical, algorithmic, and software levels. Recently, she has become interested in developing optimization algorithms with performance guarantees for data science applications. Her work has been recognized by the 2017 Young Researchers Prize by INFORMS Optimization Society and 2023 INFORMS Computing Society (ICS) prize by INFORMS Computing Society. Aida's research has been funded by NSF, DOE, and AFOSR. 

#### Thomas Rothvoss
